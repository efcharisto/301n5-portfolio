  "name":  "Smokejumper Forest Fighter",
  "age": "37",
  "employer": "EMERCOM",
  "time": "5 years, and I will continue to work here until my retirement",
  "purpose": "Smokejumpers are flown into hot areas that hotshot crews and other firefighters cannot reach. Usually, the fire is in the early stages of development in an area inaccessible to ground transportation. Smokejumpers jump in groups of two to ten – with about 100 pounds of equipment apiece – and spend three to five days fighting the fire. When finished, we gathered together our equipment and packed it out to the nearest access road, which was often many miles away."
